Reporting libdvdnav bugs:
-------------------------

The upstrean authors ask you to CC all bug reports to their
developer's mailingslist at dvd-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
Usually I'm not able to fix problems in the library itself
and will forward your bug report to them anyway.

To CC them, insert the following line after "Package: libdvdnav":
X-Debbugs-CC: dvd-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Thank you for your support.
