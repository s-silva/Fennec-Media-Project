There are a lot of things that need to be done in porting, platform
independance etc. but first of all, need to focus on minimizing the
building process by:

1. Transfer the complete project into MinGW64 for both 64bit and 32bit
   compiling.

2. Introduce a central build/rebuild for all the plugins and other
   stuff.
