There are a lot of things that need to be done in porting, platform
independance etc. but first of all, need to focus on minimizing the
building process by:

1. Transfer the complete project into MinGW64 for both 64bit and 32bit
   compiling.

   * Main Program (done)
   * Skins
   * Plugins

2. Introduce a central build/rebuild for all the plugins and other
   stuff.

3. Need to get rid of spaces in file names.

4. Add an automated build/link/rebuild and relink for every sub-project.
